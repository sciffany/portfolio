export const writeup = `I‚Äôm Tiffany Sia Chong, a final year Computer Science undergraduate at National University of Singapore with a passion for software development and computer graphics.



Coding
I have always loved solving math problems and puzzles, as well as building and creating things, so I naturally loved coding. Coding is an opportunity for me to contribute to the society while doing what I love most. Check out my work experience and software projects.

Game development
Inspired by the book Invent Your Own Computer Games in Python by Al Sweigart, I began coding in 2013 and have since then developed several games.


Graphic Design
Vibrant colors and bouncy animations of cartoons have always inspired me, and I strive to emulate this in the graphics I design. I have worked on many projects and several clients including volunteer welfare organisations.
